Unlike nightly packages, preview releases have been audited by the projectâ€™s management committee to satisfy the legal requirements of Apache Software Foundationâ€™s release policy. Preview releases are not meant to be functional, i.e. they can and highly likely will contain critical bugs or documentation errors. The latest preview release is Spark 3.0.0-preview2, published on Dec 23, 2019. You can select and download it above.
